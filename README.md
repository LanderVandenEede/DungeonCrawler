About this project:
Enter the Gungion is a hectic dungeon crawler focussing heavily on the use of guns and projectiles, the goal of a level is to defeat the dungeon boss.

My version:
I envision a hardcore dungeon crawler, in which i drop the roguelike aspects this game does have (e.g.: upgrades/looting) 
for a more class-based approach, where one hero has one gun and has to make it work.
The win condition for my game still remains defeating the dungeon boss. I plan to implement AT LEAST 4 different types of enemies, EXCLUDING the boss.
The healing shrines and similar player-aid will also be included in levels to serve as "Checkpoints", although dying will still all of your progress.

Content to implement

General gameplay: https://youtu.be/1biJ_B33ba8?t=293 (Timestamp 4:52 - 6:25)
Bossfight : https://youtu.be/1biJ_B33ba8?t=475 (Timestamp 7:54 - 8:20)

Content i do NOT plan on implementing:
-Trading Npc: this aspect makes the game more roguelike, which i am trying to avoid.
-Currencies: ditto, only exception being a Score counter displayed upon death/victory.
-Looting: ditto.
